# trinity-character

Go + Fyne character generator for the Trinity Continuum

**IDEAS**

* [ ] Have the ability for a Storyguide to create a packet of approved Paths, Roles, etc. that can be shared for creating a character

# BRANCH - STEPBASED

The idea here is that the character creation steps follow the steps of the character creation in the rulebooks. They update a readonly character sheet available in another window along side. 

Later, you can manually edit the character sheet how you like. This is just a nice walkthrough of each splat's character creation style.

# STEPS

## Step 0 - Pick splat

Each splat adjusts the paths that are available, so you need to pick that first. Also some of the skills may change (e.g. no Computers in Aether).
